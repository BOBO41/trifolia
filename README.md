# trifolia
Trifolia template/profile editor and publication tool

> This repository has the current Trifolia source code in it. However, it has not been fully prepared for open source users; authentication is linked to Active Directory and HL7, db installation scripts may not be fully functional, and no initial data is loaded with a new installation. These are tasks that Lantana intends to work on over the next 6 months.
